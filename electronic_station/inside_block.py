"""Inside Block

    https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/inside-block/

    When it comes to city planning it's important to understand the borders of
    various city structures. Parks, lakes or living blocks can be represented as
    closed polygon and can be described using cartesian coordinates on a map.
    We need a functionality to determine if a point (a building or a tree)
    lies inside the structure.

    For the purpose of this mission, a city structure may be considered a polygon
    represented as a sequence of vertex coordinates on a plane or map.
    The vertices are connected sequentially with the last vertex in the
    list connecting to the first. We are given the coordinates of the point
    which we need to check. If the point of impact lies on the edge of the
    polygon then it should be considered inside of it. For this mission, you
    need to determine whether the given point lies inside the polygon.

    For example, on the left image you see a polygon which is described by
    ((2,1),(1,5),(5,7),(7,7),(7,2)) and the point at (2,7). The result is False.
    For the right image the point lies on the edge and gets counted as inside the
    polygon, making the result True.

    Input: Two arguments. Polygon coordinates as a tuple of tuples
    with two integers each. A checking point coordinates as a tuple of two integers.

    Output: Whatever the point inside the polygon or not as a boolean.

    Precondition:
    all(x â‰¥ 0 and y â‰¥ 0 for x, y in polygon)
    point[0] â‰¥ 0 and point[1] â‰¥ 0
