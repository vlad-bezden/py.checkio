    You have been given a list of integer weights. You should help
    Stephen distribute these weights into two sets, such that the
    difference between the total weight of each set is as low as possible.

    Input data: A list of the weights as a list of integers.
    Output data: The number representing the lowest possible
    weight difference as a positive integer.

    Precondition:
    0 < len(weights) â‰¤ 10
    all(0 < x < 100 for x in weights)

    Output:
        using_combinations 0.0041
        clear_solution 0.0023
