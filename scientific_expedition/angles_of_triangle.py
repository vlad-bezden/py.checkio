"""The angles of triangle.

You are given the lengths for each side on a triangle.
You need to find all three angles for this triangle.
If the given side lengths cannot form a triangle (or form a degenerated triangle),
then you must return all angles as 0 (zero).
The angles should be represented as a list of integers in ascending order.
Each angle is measured in degrees and rounded to the nearest integer number
(Standard mathematical rounding).

Input: The lengths of the sides of a triangle as integers.
Output: Angles of a triangle in degrees as sorted list of integers.
Example:

checkio(4, 4, 4) == [60, 60, 60]
checkio(3, 4, 5) == [37, 53, 90]
checkio(2, 2, 5) == [0, 0, 0]

How it is used: This is a classical geometric task.
The ideas can be useful in topography and architecture.
With this concept you can measure an angle without the need for a protractor.

Precondition:
0 < a,b,c â‰¤ 1000
